                <h1>Panda</h1>
                <p>China, which is home to the remaining wild population of fewer than 2,500 individuals, has since the late 1980s
                instituted more stringent habitat protections.</p>

                <h1>Orangutan</h1>
                <p>orangutans restricted to the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra with number fewer than 60,000 per a 2004 study.</p>

                <h1>Tigers</h1>
                <p>Burning agriculture and human encroachment, have hugely diminished the habitat available to
                these felines, Probably fewer than 4,000 are left in the wild</p>
            </div>

            <div class="details">
                <h1>Asian Elephants</h1>
                <p>There is around 40,000–50,000 and while the tusks of Asian elephants are much smaller than their African counterparts, people are still
                poached for its ivory, meat and skin.</p>

                <h1>Gorillas</h1>
                <p>all gorillas are endangered. There are probably only around 220,000 left in the wild. Habitat encroachment and poaching
                for bushmeat, trophies, and magical talismans have led to substantial losses.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <h1>Leopards</h1>
                <p>the snow leopard is actually more closely related to the tiger, at least per genetic analysis. Probably fewer than 6,500
                remain in the wild, though due to the remote mountainous terrain preferred by the species</p>
